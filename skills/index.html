  <p>  Area of focus: image design. I plan on using images taken from a music studio and creating an interactive layout that demonstrates a narrative for my production. 
    <ol>
    <li> Utilizing Lynda and learning strategies on creating a "vintage" feel. Lynda/YouTube will also assist me in layering images, and being able to use the space that I am working with. </li>
    <li> Work on layering images in a way to create a thematic sequence. One idea I was thinking about was showing the process of making a song through image layering. </li>
    <li> Capturing these photographs will also play an essential role in putting in the time needed for this assignment. </li>
    <li> Studying YouTube videos to be able to capture clear photographs, and then applying filters/effects to enhance the vintage feel.  </li>
    <li> Do not want to involve much white space in this design. </li>
    <li> Texturizing and shading of images will be incorporated (Lynda tutorial). </li>
    <li> Pictures should be able to flow into one another and efffectively integrate it in the design. </li>
    <li> Create hyperlinks within the image(s) that would lead to the actual song that the pictures were representing. </li>
    <li> Integrate the song(s) into the page.</li>
    <li> Retouch any images with tonal adjustments/coloring.</li>
    </ol>
    Through doing image design and spending possibly more than 20 hours on this, I will be able to show the world my skills in music and design concepts as well. It will truly contribute to my future wellbeing and will make me a more well-rounded individual.

<h2> Showcase</h2>
 <p> An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience. </p>
 <p> In this project, I chose to use my cover art for "All I Need" in order to captivate an audience. The audience I was creating this for was one that was involved with music or would be interested in my musical growth. </p>
 <p> I mention before about how I achieved this, by importing a picture into illustrator/inDesign and manipulating the image to look cartoonish. I was happy with this design, but not so much with font choice </p>
 <p> In the future, I think my choice of font will definitely add a better feel to this whole project. I added a grainy effect to the 'walls' to add more depth. This was something that I was interested in doing because it showcased a world that was somewhat distorted and imperfect</p>

 <p> I might add a lighter effect on this image as well as time goes on, just because the whole theme of it is quite dark and unsettling. </p>
 
 <h2> PhotoShop: Typography/layering project </h2>
 <p> An example of how you made a choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode. </p>
 <p> In this project, I wanted to again include a musical aspect. Specifically, I wanted to include the piano similar to the logo design, but in a more 3D, captivating manner. After my friend took a few photos of me sitting down on a table, I imported that image into PS and added effects to it. </p>
 <p> These effects included grain filter, sharpening, contrast changes, hue/saturation effects, and lightness within the image. Cutting out my body with the pen tool was also nice, because I could zoom in and make the cuts precisely</p>
 <p> Once I had my body cut out appropriately, I found an image online of a piano with a key pushed down. The ultimate goal was to have my body sitting on a piano key with some text around me. I figured that if I found an image with the key pressed down, it would create a more realistic effect as to me sitting down on it.</p>
 <p> After looking at several fonts, I decided to stick with something simple and easily readable. I chose a maroon like color to match the pants I was wearing, so it seemed more aesthetically pleasing. I chose to type "MAJOR KEY ALERT," while using a different font for the word "KEY." I skewed this layer to add more variety within the image. </p>
 <p> Overall, I feel as if this project turned out the way I had envisioned it. One aspect I could incorporate next time is maybe using a different font and making it stand out more. </p>

 <h2> Movie Poster Idea </h2>
 <p> An example of how you made a choice related to comparing one thing to another. </p> 
 <p> My partner and I chose to edit the original "Finding Nemo" movie poster. By doing this, we found an image of where Dory and Marlon encounter the angler fish. Their expressions were terrifying, so we decided to use this image and add effects to make it into a horror themed film poster. </p>
 <p> When we downloaded the image and imported into Photoshop, we immediately added more contrast to the picture to add a darker feel to it, making it seem scarier. After this, I added the usual grain filter (my personal favorite). We even skewed the image to make the layout vertical, as the original image was horizontal. The image was genuinely starting to look like an actual movie poster once we did this.</p>
 <p> After searching through some fonts, we added the original 'Finding Nemo' text on the image. Then, we decided to take the project to another level by adding the text, "Based on a True Story." This in turn gave a scarier effect to the poster. As an audience, whenever we see something linked to a true story and it deals with horror, it immediately raises more attention and fear. We figured we would do this in order to evoke those emotions of being afraid.</p>
 <p> Finally, to add a little more emphasis on the horror theme, we decided to use the paintbrush tool and the color red in order to emulate blood splatter. This was the final touches to our masterpiece. </p>

<h2> Showcase</h2>
 <p> An example of how you made a choice related to genre or audience. </p>
 <p> In this project, I chose to use my cover art for "All I Need" in order to captivate an audience. The audience I was creating this for was one that was involved with music or would be interested in my musical growth. </p>
 <p> I mention before about how I achieved this, by importing a picture into illustrator/inDesign and manipulating the image to look cartoonish. I was happy with this design and font choice </p>
 <p> In the future, I think my choice of font will definitely add a better feel to this whole project. I added a grainy effect to the 'walls' to add more depth. This was something that I was interested in doing because it showcased a world that was somewhat distorted and imperfect</p>
